# Movie Recommendation System

# Project Aim: 
- The aim of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on certain criteria and user preferences. By analyzing a dataset of movies, the system will utilize various data science techniques to recommend movies that align with user tastes.

# Implementation Steps:

### 1. Importing Required Libraries

- import numpy as np
- import pandas as pd

### 2. Load Datasets

- movies = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/tmdb_5000_movies.csv")
- credits = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/tmdb_5000_credits.csv")

### 3. Data Exploration

- Explore the movies dataset using movies.head(3) to view the first few rows.
- Explore the credits dataset using credits.head(3) to view the first few rows.

### 4. Display dataset information using movies.info(), credits.info, credits.shape and movies.shape.

### 5. Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values, remove or impute missing data where necessary.
- Convert data types to appropriate formats, if required.

### 6. Feature Engineering

- Extract relevant features for the recommendation engine, such as genres, cast, crew, popularity, and more.
- Encode or transform categorical features into numerical representation.

### 7. Building the Recommendation System

- Implement a collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithm to generate movie recommendations.
- Utilize similarity metrics such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation for user-item interactions.

### 8. Model Evaluation

- Validate and evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score.
- Fine-tune the model parameters for optimal performance.

### 9. Deployment

- Deploy the recommendation system on a suitable platform or service.
- Create a user interface for interaction with the recommendation system.
